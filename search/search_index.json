Here's a list of common issues and quick fixes:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CUDA Out of Memory: When the GPU throws a fit, a few tweaks can help. First, try lowering <code>micro_batch_size</code> or <code>sequence_length</code> in the configuration to fit within the available memory. Still stuck? Try setting the <code>mlp_recompute_level</code> option to <code>activation</code> or <code>full</code> to save memory in the backward pass, or experiment with higher ZeRO stages for reduced memory usage. And if that's not enough, tensor or model parallelism may be your friend.</p> </li> <li> <p>Python Hash Seed Sync Error: Encountering an error like</p> <pre><code>RuntimeError: Desync detected for barrier train begin (66830148464 != 133042721120)\n</code></pre> <p>points to a hashing inconsistency. To fix it, set <code>PYTHONHASHSEED=0</code> in your environment variables. This ensures that Python's hash seed is consistent across all processes. If these processes have different hash seeds, they'll generate different hash values, leading to desynchronization, as seen in the error message.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>torchrun</code> Timeout Errors: If you see timeout errors related to <code>torchrun</code> during rendezvous, it could be DNS resolution or a networking issue. Check that all worker nodes are communicating properly with the master node.</p> </li> <li> <p>NCCL Errors with Timeout Messages: Oh, the joys of NCCL errors! If you see something like</p> <pre><code>Watchdog caught collective operation timeout: WorkNCCL(SeqNum=408951, OpType=_ALLGATHER_BASE, \u2026 , Timeout(ms)=600000) ran for 600351 milliseconds before timing out\n</code></pre> <p>appearing across all GPU workers, it usually means one or more hosts failed to complete a NCCL operation, causing others to block. NCCL errors can be frustrating to diagnose since they rarely specify which node or GPU caused the issue. It is difficult to surface which messages and operations are in progress during these crashes. If the issue happens at a specific moment of training like dataset preparation or model export, the issue might be that this specific procedure took too long and timed out other processes (e.g. when preparing large datasets for long training runs, or saving large models on slow storage). In this case, it can help to increase the timeout <code>distributed_timeout: 3600</code>. In some other cases, the best we can do is to restart the training job and hope it doesn't happen again. If the issue persists, it might be because of network congestion or a problematic GPU. If the worker that crashed is consistent across multiple runs, it's likely a hardware issue. If you can't resolve it, open an issue on GitHub, and we'll help you troubleshoot.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more detailed solutions, check out our GitHub Issues page.

Only the maintainer is authorized to create and publish releases. This ensures consistency, quality, and accountability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work: Contributors with write access can propose changes and prep the repository for a release (steps 1 and 2 below in the \"Release Process\" section). But tagging and publishing the release? That's the maintainer's job.</p> </li> <li> <p>Versioning Made Simple: Fast-LLM sticks to Semantic Versioning (aka semver). Here's the gist:</p> <ul> <li>MAJOR versions (like <code>1.0.0</code>) are for big, stable, feature-complete milestones. Since we're still in pre-1.0 territory, we don't have these yet.</li> <li>MINOR versions (e.g., <code>0.2.0</code>) introduce new features and may include breaking changes, as we are in the pre-1.0 phase of development. While we strive for backward compatibility where feasible, breaking changes are acceptable until we reach 1.0.0. MINOR releases are the main focus of our current development efforts. They're tied to milestones and are released on a regular schedule.</li> <li>PATCH versions (e.g., <code>0.2.1</code>) squash bugs and include small, critical fixes without introducing new functionality. These releases are based on stable <code>main</code> commits and are the recommended choice for production-like use cases and important experiments. While we encourage internal and adventurous users to test <code>main</code>, PATCH releases ensure stability for users who need reliability.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Milestones are for MINOR Releases: Each milestone corresponds to a MINOR version (<code>0.2.0</code>, <code>0.3.0</code>, etc.) and includes all issues and pull requests targeted for that release. Milestones have due dates and are used to track progress toward the next MINOR release. PATCH releases?

Abstract variable names such as <code>x</code> are however OK for generic methods where more descriptive names aren't appropriate (ex. <code>add(x, y)</code>).</li> <li>Please avoid abbreviations, especially domain-specific ones.

There should be very little ambiguity, because name clashes are uncommon within Fast-LLM, and external identifiers are already clearly marked as such.</li> </ul> <p>Configuration modules</p> <p>Fast-LLM supports instantiation and validation of configurations with a barebone installation. Because of this, modules that contain configuration classes (usually named <code>config.py</code>) should not include any top-level third-party import (except for those installed in the barebone install), and the same applies for configuration initialization and validation methods.

See the Hugging Face implementation for an example.</p> <p>To perform the conversion, the checkpoint handler relies on a list of <code>ParamConverter</code> objects, which describe how individual parameters (or in some case multiple ones) should be converted. The <code>ParamConverter</code> base interface is a dataclass consisting of two variables and two methods:</p> <ul> <li><code>fast_llm_names: tuple[tuple[str, ...], ...]</code>: An array of entry names on the Fast-LLM side, in tuple format.

Exporting works as follows (importing work similarly): *The handler creates an empty export config dict, then loops over its list of converters. For each converter, it: *   Reads the value of each parameter defined in <code>fast_llm_names</code>, and gathers them in a tuple. *Calls <code>converter.export_params</code>, providing the set of read values as argument. *   Ensure that the returned value has the correct length (that of <code>export_names</code>) *   Set the respective values in the export config dict.</p> <p>About <code>MISSING</code> and <code>DEFAULT</code></p> <p>If a value is not found during import, it will be replaced by the <code>MISSING</code> tag. The converter's <code>import_params</code> has the opportunity to handle this missing value, and if a <code>MISSING</code>, the handler will throw an error because it does not know what value to set on the Fast-LLM side.</p> <p>The <code>MISSING</code> tag is also supported during export, but has a different meaning as the value is always expected to be found in the Fast-LLM configuration. Instead, <code>export_params</code> may return a <code>MISSING</code> tag indicating that no value should not be added to the Fast-LLM config. It may also return <code>DEFAULT</code>, which will be replaced by the default value for the configuration parameter.</p> <p>Note that the handling of <code>MISSING</code> and <code>DEFAULT</code> is experimental and may be improved in the future.</p>"},{"location":"developer_guide/conversion/#state-conversion","title":"State conversion","text":"<p>State conversion follows the same principle as configuration conversion, but acts on flat dictionaries of state tensors. Converters are defined by subclassing <code>WeightConverter</code>, with the interface:</p> <ul> <li><code>fast_llm_name: str | tuple[str, ...]</code>: An entry name or array of entry names on the Fast-LLM side. For example, <code>((transformer, head_groups),)</code> refers to the single entry <code>config[\"transformer\"][\"head_groups\"]</code>.</li> <li><code>export_name: str | tuple[str, ...]</code>: An entry name or array of entry names on the external side.</li> <li><code>export_weight(self, weight: tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]) -&gt; tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]</code>: This method takes the state dict entries corresponding to <code>fast_llm_name</code> (in the same order), and returns converted entries corresponding to <code>export_name</code>.</li> <li><code>import_weight(self, weight: tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]) -&gt; tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]</code>: The converse of<code>export_weight</code>, converting state dict entries corresponding to <code>export_name</code> into those corresponding to <code>fast_llm_name</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Fast-LLM offers several generic state dict converter classes, including:</p> <ul> <li><code>WeightConverter</code>: The base class allows for a simple 1-1 mapping between parameters with optional renaming, similar to <code>RenameParamConverter</code>.</li> <li><code>SplitWeightConverter</code>: A 1-N mapping, where a Fast-LLM parameter corresponds to multiple equally-sized chunks in the external side.

Here is an example where a weight needs to be transposed during conversion:</p> <pre><code>class TransposeWeightConverter(WeightConverter):\n    def export_weight(\n        self, weight: tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]\n    ) -&gt; tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]:\n        Assert.eq(len(weight), 1)\n        return (weight[0][:].transpose().contiguous(),)\n\n    def import_weight(\n        self, weight: tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]\n    ) -&gt; tuple[torch.Tensor | SafeTensorSlice, ...]:\n        Assert.eq(len(weight), 1)\n        return (weight[0][:].transpose().contiguous(),)\n</code></pre> <p>We define the list of weight converters in the <code>_create_weight_converters</code> method.

This boosted GPU utilization and brought down training time by 20% compared to other frameworks. Fast-LLM made sure every GPU cycle was used efficiently, cutting down on idle time across the board.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support for Long Contexts: With Fast-LLM's built-in Grouped Query Attention (GQA), StarCoder2-3B was able to leverage a 16,384 token context window. This is essential for code comprehension, where context often spans hundreds of lines or more. GQA enabled the model to hold extensive context across sequences, which translates into better understanding of long code snippets, in-depth documentation, and detailed coding conversations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) Training: Fast-LLM supported FIM training objectives natively, allowing StarCoder2-3B to complete and understand code by predicting missing snippets in various contexts.
