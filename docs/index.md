Introducing **Fast-LLM**, the cutting-edge open-source library built for training large language models (LLMs) with **unmatched speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency**. Developed by [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/)'s Foundation Models Lab, Fast-LLM is engineered to meet the rigorous demands of professional AI researchers, AI/ML engineers, academic and industrial research institutions, and enterprise product development teams pushing the limits of generative AI. **Achieve groundbreaking research and high-stakes production goals faster with Fast-LLM.**

[Start your journey with Fast-LLM](quick-start.md) and explore the future of LLM training. Dive into [real-world use cases](recipes/train-llama-8b.md) to see how Fast-LLM can elevate your training workflows.

## Why Fast-LLM?

Fast-LLM is designed for professionals who demand exceptional performance for efficient large-scale (FLOPS) language model training on GPUs. Fast-LLM integrates effortlessly into existing ML pipelines and goes beyond off-the-shelf commercial frameworks, like NVIDIA NeMo Megatron, to deliver a **robust, flexible, and high-performance open-source alternative**. Whether you're optimizing for speed, cost, or scalability, Fast-LLM helps you get the most out of your training infrastructure.

### The Fast-LLM Advantage

Fast-LLM isn't just another library, **it's a platform for powering the next generation of AI breakthroughs**. Here's what sets it apart:

-   **üöÄ Purpose-Built for Small- and Large-Scale AI:** Optimized specifically for training language models of all sizes, Fast-LLM excels from **small models around 1B parameters to massive clusters running 70B+ parameter models**, with kernels that are fine-tuned for maximum throughput across this entire range. At 10B-parameter scale, Fast-LLM avoids costly 3D-paralelism through memory optimization techniques such as ZeRO and activation recomputation, whereas at 100B-parameter scale, Fast-LLM optimally supports 3D-parallelism; making Fast-LLM the go-to choice for diverse training needs.

-   **üß† Unified Support for GPT-Like Architectures:** Fast-LLM **unifies all GPT-like model implementations** in a [single Python file](https://github.com/ServiceNow/Fast-LLM/blob/main/fast_llm/models/gpt/model.py), and unlike HuggingFace transformers where every model has its own, mostly independent, implementation, Fast-LLM reduces coding and adapts effortlessly, even with custom architectures.

-   **üí∞ Cost Efficiency That Sets Fast-LLM Apart:**

    -   **Lower Training Costs:** With higher throughput per GPU, Fast-LLM reduces the training time required. For instance, training models can cheaper compared to other frameworks due to faster processing and better memory efficiency.

    -   **More Tokens for Your Budget:** Train on more tokens for the same budget, leading to better-trained models without breaking your financial constraints.

-   **üîì Openness Without Compromise:** Fast-LLM's open-source approach ensures that you can **fully customize and extend the library** to fit your exact needs, without the restrictions of proprietary software. Developed transparently by a community of experts on GitHub, every change is **publicly discussed and vetted**, fostering **trust and collaboration** so you can innovate with confidence, knowing the entire development process and decision making is out in the open.

-   **üåç Community-Driven Development:** Built by professionals for professionals, Fast-LLM's development is transparent, with an open invitation to the community to contribute. [**Join the Fast-LLM community**](join-us.md) to help shape the future of large-scale AI training.

### Key Features

Fast-LLM offers all the capabilities you need to accelerate your LLM training and **push the boundaries of what's possible**:

-   **üöÄ Speed Like No Other:** Achieve record-breaking training throughput with Fast-LLM. For instance, train Mistral-7B at **9,800 tokens/s/GPU** on a 4-node cluster with 32 H100 GPUs (batch size 32, sequence length 8k). Our optimized kernels, advanced parallelism, and memory-efficient techniques drastically reduce training time and cost.

-   **üì° Unmatched Scalability:** Seamlessly scale from a single GPU to large compute clusters. Fast-LLM supports 3D parallelism (data, tensor, and pipeline), sequence length parallelism, and ZeRO-1,2,3 techniques for maximum memory efficiency. Scale to the size you need without sacrificing performance.

-   **üéõÔ∏è Total Flexibility:** Compatible with all major language model architectures, including but not limited to Llama, Mistral, StarCoder, and Mixtral. Fast-LLM's modular design gives you full control over your training workflows.

-   **üì¶ Seamless Integration:** Integrate smoothly with popular libraries such as [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers). Benefit from Fast-LLM's optimizations without disrupting your existing pipelines.

-   **üõ†Ô∏è Professional-Grade Tools:** Enjoy mixed precision training, large batch training, and gradient accumulation. Fast-LLM ensures reproducibility through deterministic behavior and provides pre-built Docker images, YAML configurations, and a simple, intuitive command-line interface.
