Fast-LLM is built for speed and scalability to minimize training costs. Fast-LLM's advanced parallelism techniques, memory-efficient implementations, and kernel optimizations enable users to achieve significant cost savings compared to other training frameworks like NVIDIA NeMo Megatron and others. Let's dive into a detailed comparison of training costs across different frameworks, demonstrating how Fast-LLM delivers more value for your budget.

## Comparing Training Costs Across Frameworks

To demonstrate the cost-saving potential of Fast-LLM, we've compared the cost of training a language model on various frameworks under the same budget and training duration assumptions. We assume a cost of **USD 2.50 per H100 GPU per hour** for these calculations.

### Scenario 1: Training on 1 Trillion Tokens

| Framework      | Training Throughput (tokens/s/H100) | GPUs | Cost per Hour (USD) | Estimated Training Time (hours) | Total Cost (USD) |

#### Scenario 2: Training with a Fixed Budget of $100,000

**Key Takeaways:**

- With a fixed budget, Fast-LLM trains on significantly more tokens, thanks to its higher throughput.
- This translates directly into a better-trained model within the same budget constraints.

### Cost Efficiency Graphs

The graphs below illustrate the cost efficiency of Fast-LLM compared to other frameworks. The first graph shows the total cost for training on 1 trillion tokens, while the second graph displays the total tokens trained within a $100,000 budget.

#### Graph 1: Total Cost for Training on 1 Trillion Tokens

Plot the frameworks along the x-axis, and the total training costs on the y-axis. Fast-LLM should be highlighted as the lowest cost.

#### Graph 2: Total Tokens Trained Within a $100,000 Budget

Plot the frameworks along the x-axis, and the total tokens trained on the y-axis, showing how Fast-LLM enables more training progress within the same budget.

### Why Fast-LLM Delivers More Value

Fast-LLM's advanced optimizations, including memory efficiency techniques and throughput enhancements, not only cut down training time but also translate directly into cost savings. This allows users to either reduce budget requirements or achieve better training quality within fixed budget constraints.
