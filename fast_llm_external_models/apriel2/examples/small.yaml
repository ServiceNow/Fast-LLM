# Surgery modifier: reduce to 3 blocks for fast testing
#
# This is a composable surgery spec that can be combined with any other surgery.
# Surgery specs are applied left-to-right, with later specs overriding earlier ones.
#
# Usage (compose with stochastic_supernet.yaml):
#   python convert.py ServiceNow-AI/Apriel-1.5-15b-Thinker output/ \
#       --surgery examples/stochastic_supernet.yaml \
#       --surgery examples/small.yaml
#
# This produces the same result as a single "stochastic_supernet_small.yaml" would,
# but demonstrates the composability of surgery specs.
