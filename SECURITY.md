## ServiceNow is Committed to Full Transparency

If you find a vulnerability in ServiceNow systems, products, or network infrastructure, our [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://www.servicenow.com/company/trust/privacy/responsible-disclosure.html) is the place to make a report.

If you find a vulnerability in this open-source project published by the ServiceNow Research team, please email [servicenow-research@servicenow.com](mailto:servicenow-research@servicenow.com) to report your findings.

We will process your report as soon as possible, depending on the severity of your report. We appreciate everyone's help in disclosing vulnerabilities in a responsible manner.
 
## Guidelines

Please follow the guidelines below when [disclosing vulnerabilities](https://www.servicenow.com/company/trust/privacy/responsible-disclosure.html):

- Report any potential security issue as soon as possible. ServiceNow will make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide sufficient detail to reproduce the vulnerability, including proof of concept. The use of ReproNow to demonstrate reproducibility is encouraged but not required.
- Please do not disclose an issue to the public or any third party until ServiceNow has resolved it.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and interruption or degradation of our services. Only interact with accounts you own or have explicit permission from the account holder to access.
- Redact any language or images that may identify the program or ServiceNow customers from information about a resolved vulnerability.
- Do not engage in disruptive testing (such as Denial of Service attacks) or any action that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and systems.
- Do not engage in social engineering or phishing against customers or employees.
